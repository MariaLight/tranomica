Quotations for this metal are completely determined by supply and demand in industry, and therefore by the state of the world economy[1]. When leading industrial companies increase the pace and volume of production, create thousands of jobs, and the state stimulates the economy, the price of palladium increases.</p><p>This becomes obvious if we analyze the industrial applications of palladium. 80% of all palladium production is used in the automotive industry, namely in the production of catalytic converters (catalysts), which are built into the exhaust system of a car with an internal combustion engine (ICE) to neutralize 90% of the exhaust gases[2].</p><p>As you know, today the world economy is in a state of green transition, striving to use renewable energy sources, develop electric vehicles and curb the release of exhaust gases from internal combustion engines into the atmosphere. Despite the rapid pace of entry into the automotive industry, there are still many traditional cars[3], which is why palladium is a key link for countries leading the way in green policies.</p><p>Palladium is also used in electronics, dentistry, pharmaceuticals and jewelry. However, these applications are extremely small compared to the automotive industry.</p><p>The geographic distribution of palladium is extremely limited due to its rarity. This metal is the rarest among all other noble metals — its deposits in the world are 15 times less than platinum and 30 times less than gold[4]. In 2021, the leaders in the mining and production of palladium were South Africa (80 thousand tons), Russia (74 thousand tons), Canada (17 thousand tons) and the USA (14 thousand tons)[5]. On the other hand, the largest producer of palladium in 2022 was MMC Norilsk Nickel with 44% of all world production.</p><picture><source srcset="assets/img/pages/example.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="assets/img/pages/example.png" alt=""></picture><p>Gold, silver and platinum are popular among investors and ordinary people, but what do you know about palladium?
